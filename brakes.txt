How do car brakes actualy work? 
Most people have no idea, so let's not be like most people and learn about them.

Most cars nowadays use hydraulic brakes

ofcourse there are more types for example electric brakes in Electric Vehicles and hybrids but a lot of them still use hydraulic brakes.

But how do they work?

Let's start from the cockpit of your vehicle.

When you press on the pedal of your car.

You'll push on something called "brake peddal". Haha got you. So brake peddal will push on "Brake master cylinder" which will distribute a presure thru brake pipes and lines, which will put pressure in "Brake calipers" which will push out a cylinder shaped piston that will push into "Brake pads" which will push on "brake discs" which will slow down or stop your car. Depends on how much pressure your foot puts on the pedal.

UFF, a lot of pushing huh? HAHA

Brakes are divided into two categories drum brakes and disc brakes.

Drum brakes are older, cheaper and for few decades are used in lower end, smaller and lighter car's rear wheels. Drum brakes are generally less expensive to manufacture and maintain, which can make them a viable option for budget-conscious car manufacturers. However, it is worth noting that the industry is increasingly shifting towards disc brakes due to their superior performance and braking capabilities.

Disc brakes are a norm and are a common type of braking system used in vehicles. Their advantages include better stopping power, improved performance in wet conditions, and longer lifespan. They also provide more consistent braking and require less maintenance. However, they tend to be more expensive to manufacture and can be more complex to repair compared to drum brakes. Overall, disc brakes are considered superior in terms of performance and safety, which is why they are commonly used in modern vehicles.
